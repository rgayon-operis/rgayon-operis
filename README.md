# Bonjour !
*Here's a bit about me:*
- 👋 Rafael Gayon
- 👩 She / Her / Elle
- 📍 Nantes, France
- 👩‍💻 DevOps Gal
- 🗣️ French, English, Spanish

*Stream of consciousness:* I only use Windows because of work. I'd rather have fun with Xenia. I write a whole lot of yaml (And some actual code whenever I can). I GPG-Sign my commits. I wish the internet was more interoperable. Working pretty much exclusively on WSL. Why is Jira ? The GitHub CLI is actually awesome, y'all just haters. No, seriously, why the hell is Jira ? And how have they been working on this for over twenty years ?! I have a love-hate relationship with GitHub, and it's not what you think.

All views and statements are my own.

I would write an [H-Card](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card) somewhere, but I'm not there just yet.

# Configuration and dotfiles.
Here is a list of my different configurations:
- [Ansible](https://github.com/rgayon-operis/ansible-config)
- [Fish](https://github.com/rgayon-operis/fish-config) (Might I recommend the [tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide) prompt ?)
- [NeoVim](https://github.com/rgayon-operis/nvim-config) (Requires [nvchad](https://nvchad.com/))
- [Tmux](https://github.com/rgayon-operis/tmux-config)
- And more if I think of any...

# I love Blue Sharks !
Blahaj is a soft toy shark plushie sold by IKEA (not sponsored, I just really like them). I hope you can find some solace in knowing they exist. I have a couple myself, and I love them very much.
