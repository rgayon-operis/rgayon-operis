# Bonjour !
*Here's a bit about me:*
- 👋 Rafael Gayon
- 👩 She / Her / Elle
- 📍 Nantes, France
- 👩‍💻 DevOps Gal
- 🗣️ French, English, Spanish

I only use Windows because of work. I'd rather have fun with Xenia. I write a whole lot of yaml (And some actual code whenever I can). I GPG-Sign my commits.

I would write an [H-Card](https://microformats.org/wiki/h-card) somewhere, but I'm not there just yet.

# I love Blue Sharks !
Blahaj are a soft toy shark plushie sold by Ikea (not sponsored, I just really like them). I hope you can find some solace in knowing they exist. I have a couple myself, and I love them very much.
